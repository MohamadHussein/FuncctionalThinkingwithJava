# Functional Thinking with Java

This project was created to document my learning journey where I learn new concepts and apply them on simple use-cases to solidify my understanding.

Hopefully others will find this project helpful. 

This repo is about functional programming in JAVA, where I implement and use some of the most common operations used in the functional paradigm.

## Covered Concepts and Cases 
* Composition
* Currying
* Joining
* Reduce

## Getting Started
It's preferable that you do some reading on functional programming concepts before you dive into the code.
You may start by cloning the project up and running it on your local machine.
